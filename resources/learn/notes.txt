- current issues: overflow once a certain amount of items are input;
- possible issues: 
    - the container seems to be responsive could cause issues in regards to its items
    - 
    -
- solved issues:  the ressignment issue cause logic problems seems fixed


const container ->
    - should be display type flex
    - shold wrap items in container
    - flex stretch
    - shouldnt allow overflow
    - remove container and create a new one every time container is cleared

const input ->
    - min value is one
    - max value is 100
    - disable functionailty once 100 items are reached
    - will use a if else statement to check for amount of items
    - shoud'nt allow string values or symbols
    - should add up when a number is inputted
    - add button for functionailty

const items -> 
    - should stretch to fit container
    - should take up a even amount of space in refernece to other items
    - on hover color should be altered 
    - item should shrink indefinitly

const clear ->
    - basically restarts the program when cleared

 extra ->
-- within the body add others compants such as the label , input, and btn;

how would you incorporate the first constant?
    - create a physical div in the html (parent node)
    - include fragment for better functionailty -- (dont understand this much yet)
    - in css incorporate the proper styling such as flex , flex direction, height , width, and overflow(possibly?!)
    - in javascript assign a variable to the container using the dom

what will the first constant be used for?
    - appending the children to the dom
    - giving the items a parent node to be placed in
    - gives the web page some structure
