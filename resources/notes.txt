- current issues: overflow once a certain amount of items are input;
- possible issues: the reassigning after every click may cause problems with the logic (trying to find a way to record input values)
- solved issues: 


const container ->
    - should be display type flex
    - shold wrap items in container
    - flex stretch
    - shouldnt allow overflow
    - remove container and create a new one every time container is cleared

const input ->
    - min value is one
    - max value is 100
    - disable functionailty once 100 items are reached
    - will use a if else statement to check for amount of items
    - shoudlnt allow string values
