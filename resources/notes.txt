- current issues: overflow once a certain amount of items are input;
- possible issues: the reassigning after every click may cause problems with the logic (trying to find a way to record input values)
- solved issues: 


const container ->
    - should be display type flex
    - shold wrap items in container
    - flex stretch
    - shouldnt allow overflow

const input ->
    - min value is one
    - max value is 100
    - disable functionailty once 100 items are reached
